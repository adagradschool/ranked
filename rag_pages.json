Design Situated at the prestigious address of 425 Park Avenue in an L&L Holding office tower, Four Twenty Five boasts a remarkable design by the esteemed Lord Norman Foster of Foster+Partners, a recipient of the prestigious Pritzker Prize. Four Twenty Five delivers extraordinary experiences on both its Mezzanine and Street levels. The captivating cocktail lounge and bar downstairs feature 45-foot high ceilings, complemented by a 24-foot painting created by artist Larry Poons and stunning staircase. Enhancing its appeal, the restaurant's Mezzanine level features an intimate dining room suspended above Park Avenue showcasing a stunning open kitchen. Sustainability The partnership between L&L and Jean-Georges works so well because they are symbiotic in their approach. Long before Four Twenty Five, Jean-Georges had made an effort and taken necessary steps to promote sustainability in his restaurants, both in the kitchen and the dining room. The building\u2019s green ethos goes hand in hand with how Jean-Georges runs his restaurants. From the lights to the furniture, ingredients and more - conscious decisions have been made to create little to zero carbon footprint. The restaurants in New York and around the world work with local and organic farms to source ingredients - from produce to meat and dairy. The culinary team puts great emphasis and devotes significant resources to work with local farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket, sustainable seafood suppliers, ethically raised poultry and meat and local artists. Jean-Georges A full-circle moment for Jean-Georges. In 1986, Jean-Georges began his New York journey at Lafayette, steps away from Four Twenty Five. In 2023, he opens Four Twenty Five, marking the 62nd restaurant in his repertoire of worldwide restaurants. Born and raised on the outskirts of Strasbourg in Alsace, France, Jean-Georges' earliest family memories are of food. He began his training in a work-study program at Auberge de I'Ill as an apprentice to Chef Paul Haeberlin, then went on to work under Paul Bocuse and Master Chef Louis Outhier at L'Oasis in southern France. With this impressive three-star Michelin background, Jean-Georges traveled to Asia and continued his training at the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok, the Meridien Hotel in Singapore and the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong. It was during this time spent working and traveling throughout Asia that Jean-Georges developed his love for the exotic and aromatic flavors of the East. His signature cuisine abandons the traditional use of meat stocks and creams and instead features the intense flavors and textures from vegetable juices, fruit essences, light broths, and herbal vinaigrettes. Jean-Georges\u2019 culinary vision has redefined industry standards and revolutionized the way we eat.

This dialogue between field and kitchen is what makes our farm-to-table philosophy truly possible. Our crop plan nurtures signature, vegetable-forward cuisine while cultivating singular expressions such as black garlic, dried herbs, microgreens, and heritage polenta corn. Vegetables are allowed to reach their full maturity before harvest, ensuring they stand as defining elements of the plate. With our own farm, ingredients continue to evolve beyond the season, inspiring preservation, pickling, and quiet acts of experimentation. Even our cover crops are part of the narrative: Daikon and buckwheat flowers harvested not only enrich the soil, but also bring beauty to the table. Every dish becomes a conversation \u2014 one that begins in the earth and finds its voice in the kitchen. \u201cFarmers can feed communities, but it takes communities to support farms. Fortunately for Rigor Hill Farm, it exists within a supportive ecosystem of relationships with One White Street, Rigor Hill Market, and a devoted Tribeca community.\u201d - Luke Ippoliti, Farm Manager",

Reservation line +1 718-424-1869 \u201c Up a quiet staircase and behind an unassuming door is a small room with a compact kitchen serving up some solid beef momos. Ours were huge, juicy, and generously filled with flavorful meat. The wrappers were thin and pleasantly chewy though slightly overcooked. The chili sauce on the table added a nice kick of spice that I really enjoyed. \u201d - Christina Huynh \u201c Phayul Restaurant offers a cozy, albeit compact, dining experience with a lively and constantly bustling atmosphere. The space is small, and it\u2019s common to find yourself waiting for a table, which is a good sign for their business but may cause some inconvenience for guests looking for a more relaxed experience. The service was satisfactory, considering there was only one server handling all the tables. This may be due to the restaurant\u2019s limited serving area, but the staff remained efficient despite the busy environment. As for the food, it was a mixed but generally positive experience. The Chicken Shapta was delicious and cooked to perfection, while the Lhasa Chicken stood out with its rich flavors. The fried rice, while decent, didn\u2019t particularly shine. The Momos were enjoyable, though not remarkably different from others in the city. However, the Mokthuk and shredded potato was somewhat disappointing compared to the other dishes. Overall, Phayul Restaurant delivers on flavor with its standout dishes, but could improve on the dining experience, both in service and space. A great spot for flavorful Tibetan cuisine, especially if you\u2019re not in a rush. \u201d - CHANDAN RANJIT \u201c Whenever I touch base back to my second home this is my first spot. You don\u2019t understand, this place is so good, as soon as I wake up I crave it and then have to wait the grueling hours before it\u2019s open. I\u2019m pretty basic and get the veggie momos with a cucumber salad but the last time I dine I had these pan fried momos that had this red sauce. It was really good. I can\u2019t wait to come back Queens, I miss this place so much!! \u201d - L K \u201c From the moment I stepped into Phayul, I knew I was in for something special. The cozy, unpretentious space carried the warmth of a home-cooked meal, and as each dish arrived, it became clear that this was a place where flavors were crafted with care, tradition, and an undeniable love for Tibetan cuisine. We began with the Cucumber Salad, which was nothing short of perfection. The crisp cucumbers were tossed in a fiery, garlicky dressing that delivered just the right amount of heat ,spicy enough to excite the palate without overwhelming it. The addition of crunchy peanuts provided an unexpected but welcome contrast, adding depth to an already vibrant dish. It was bold, refreshing, and the perfect way to start the meal. The White Laphing, a dish celebrated for its silky texture and cool, chewy bite, was enjoyable but a bit too mild in flavor. While the texture was spot on, it lacked the fiery tang I had anticipated. A drizzle of chili oil and soy sauce helped elevate it, but on its own, it felt a little subdued compared to the rest of the meal. Then came the Beef Thenthuk, and from the very first spoonful, I knew it was something truly special. The hand-pulled noodles had a perfect chew, floating in a rich, deeply savory broth infused with garlic, ginger, cumin, and slow-simmered beef. The vegetables provided a fresh contrast, and the beef itself was incredibly tender, melting effortlessly. What stood out the most was that it wasn\u2019t spicy, making it an ideal dish for those who prefer deep, rich flavors without heat. It was pure comfort in a bowl nourishing, hearty, and utterly satisfying. In contrast, the Beef Lhasa Fried Noodles delivered a fiery, umami-packed punch. The chewy noodles carried the essence of smoky wok hei, while the beef was perfectly caramelized, adding an incredible depth of flavor. Tossed in a sauce that was both spicy and slightly sweet, with hints of garlic, dried chilies, and scallions, this dish was absolutely addictive. Every bite balanced heat, savoriness, and a touch of smokiness, making it one of the absolute standouts of the night. The Pan-Fried Tsel Momos were nothing short of immaculate. Crispy on the outside, yet soft and pillowy on the inside, these dumplings were made with a smooth, well-seasoned potato filling that was simple yet extraordinary. The contrast in textures was executed flawlessly, and when paired with the accompanying chili sauce, every bite left me craving more. Then came the Fried Lamb Ribs, which were an absolute showstopper. The crispy, golden-brown exterior gave way to succulent, fall-off-the-bone meat, infused with a bold mix of cumin, chili powder, and coriander. Each bite carried a smoky, slightly spicy aroma that lingered beautifully, making it one of the most unforgettable dishes of the night. Finally, we ended with the Tsak Sha La Kor Hot, a beef, radish, and Tibetan spice soup that felt like a warm embrace on a cold evening. The slow-braised beef was melt-in-your mouth tender, while the radish absorbed the deep, aromatic flavors of the broth. Infused with ginger, Sichuan pepper, dried chilies, and warming Tibetan spices, the soup had a complexity that unfolded with each spoonful. It wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly spicy, but the subtle heat built up beautifully, making it the perfect, comforting end to an incredible meal. Each dish tells a story of tradition, spice, and comfort, with an impeccable balance of heat, umami, and texture. I left full, satisfied, and already planning my next visit. Phayul is an absolute must-visit. Highly, highly recommended! \u201d - Kimberly Lim Legaspi \u201c Didn\u2019t appreciate the 18% gratitude without asking when paid by card. They asked me to come on the front to pay and I was on a call so I would have gone after finishing. After a while they brought my card and bill and I see that they added tip on their own. \u201d - Mushsharat Bisha",

Reservation line +1 718-424-1869 \u201c Up a quiet staircase and behind an unassuming door is a small room with a compact kitchen serving up some solid beef momos. Ours were huge, juicy, and generously filled with flavorful meat. The wrappers were thin and pleasantly chewy though slightly overcooked. The chili sauce on the table added a nice kick of spice that I really enjoyed. \u201d - Christina Huynh \u201c Phayul Restaurant offers a cozy, albeit compact, dining experience with a lively and constantly bustling atmosphere. The space is small, and it\u2019s common to find yourself waiting for a table, which is a good sign for their business but may cause some inconvenience for guests looking for a more relaxed experience. The service was satisfactory, considering there was only one server handling all the tables. This may be due to the restaurant\u2019s limited serving area, but the staff remained efficient despite the busy environment. As for the food, it was a mixed but generally positive experience. The Chicken Shapta was delicious and cooked to perfection, while the Lhasa Chicken stood out with its rich flavors. The fried rice, while decent, didn\u2019t particularly shine. The Momos were enjoyable, though not remarkably different from others in the city. However, the Mokthuk and shredded potato was somewhat disappointing compared to the other dishes. Overall, Phayul Restaurant delivers on flavor with its standout dishes, but could improve on the dining experience, both in service and space. A great spot for flavorful Tibetan cuisine, especially if you\u2019re not in a rush. \u201d - CHANDAN RANJIT \u201c Whenever I touch base back to my second home this is my first spot. You don\u2019t understand, this place is so good, as soon as I wake up I crave it and then have to wait the grueling hours before it\u2019s open. I\u2019m pretty basic and get the veggie momos with a cucumber salad but the last time I dine I had these pan fried momos that had this red sauce. It was really good. I can\u2019t wait to come back Queens, I miss this place so much!! \u201d - L K \u201c From the moment I stepped into Phayul, I knew I was in for something special. The cozy, unpretentious space carried the warmth of a home-cooked meal, and as each dish arrived, it became clear that this was a place where flavors were crafted with care, tradition, and an undeniable love for Tibetan cuisine. We began with the Cucumber Salad, which was nothing short of perfection. The crisp cucumbers were tossed in a fiery, garlicky dressing that delivered just the right amount of heat ,spicy enough to excite the palate without overwhelming it. The addition of crunchy peanuts provided an unexpected but welcome contrast, adding depth to an already vibrant dish. It was bold, refreshing, and the perfect way to start the meal. The White Laphing, a dish celebrated for its silky texture and cool, chewy bite, was enjoyable but a bit too mild in flavor. While the texture was spot on, it lacked the fiery tang I had anticipated. A drizzle of chili oil and soy sauce helped elevate it, but on its own, it felt a little subdued compared to the rest of the meal. Then came the Beef Thenthuk, and from the very first spoonful, I knew it was something truly special. The hand-pulled noodles had a perfect chew, floating in a rich, deeply savory broth infused with garlic, ginger, cumin, and slow-simmered beef. The vegetables provided a fresh contrast, and the beef itself was incredibly tender, melting effortlessly. What stood out the most was that it wasn\u2019t spicy, making it an ideal dish for those who prefer deep, rich flavors without heat. It was pure comfort in a bowl nourishing, hearty, and utterly satisfying. In contrast, the Beef Lhasa Fried Noodles delivered a fiery, umami-packed punch. The chewy noodles carried the essence of smoky wok hei, while the beef was perfectly caramelized, adding an incredible depth of flavor. Tossed in a sauce that was both spicy and slightly sweet, with hints of garlic, dried chilies, and scallions, this dish was absolutely addictive. Every bite balanced heat, savoriness, and a touch of smokiness, making it one of the absolute standouts of the night. The Pan-Fried Tsel Momos were nothing short of immaculate. Crispy on the outside, yet soft and pillowy on the inside, these dumplings were made with a smooth, well-seasoned potato filling that was simple yet extraordinary. The contrast in textures was executed flawlessly, and when paired with the accompanying chili sauce, every bite left me craving more. Then came the Fried Lamb Ribs, which were an absolute showstopper. The crispy, golden-brown exterior gave way to succulent, fall-off-the-bone meat, infused with a bold mix of cumin, chili powder, and coriander. Each bite carried a smoky, slightly spicy aroma that lingered beautifully, making it one of the most unforgettable dishes of the night. Finally, we ended with the Tsak Sha La Kor Hot, a beef, radish, and Tibetan spice soup that felt like a warm embrace on a cold evening. The slow-braised beef was melt-in-your mouth tender, while the radish absorbed the deep, aromatic flavors of the broth. Infused with ginger, Sichuan pepper, dried chilies, and warming Tibetan spices, the soup had a complexity that unfolded with each spoonful. It wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly spicy, but the subtle heat built up beautifully, making it the perfect, comforting end to an incredible meal. Each dish tells a story of tradition, spice, and comfort, with an impeccable balance of heat, umami, and texture. I left full, satisfied, and already planning my next visit. Phayul is an absolute must-visit. Highly, highly recommended! \u201d - Kimberly Lim Legaspi \u201c Didn\u2019t appreciate the 18% gratitude without asking when paid by card. They asked me to come on the front to pay and I was on a call so I would have gone after finishing. After a while they brought my card and bill and I see that they added tip on their own. \u201d - Mushsharat Bisha",

Infatuation Dec 23, 2025 7 1 2 Share Since we last spoke, eight members of our team have gone to Bistrot Ha , the new spot from the Ha\u2019s Snack Bar team. Results have been, well, mixed. Some were disappointed. Others shouldn\u2019t have ordered that third lychee cosmo. When we weren\u2019t eating fish sauce at the hottest new place to eat fish sauce, we visited over 50 bars and restaurants in NYC. Hillary went to the place for a power lunch, Jonathan finally visited the most charming Italian restaurant in his neighborhood, and Sonal ate really good eggs at really good places two nights in a row. Also, this is our last Substack of the year. Thanks for playing < 3. We hope you have a very happy and healthy and silly new year, and if you have made the smart choice to not host, here are your New Year\u2019s dinners and your New Year\u2019s parties . Leave a comment Bistrot Ha - Willa I went with Gabe , Bryan , and Will , seated right next to ardy party of course! I know they rushed her a bit, but I had fun! Definitely highs and lows menu wise, but also it was day three, so I have faith. I also remember Molly having a similar experience on her first visit to Ha\u2019s. I am allowed to say \u201chighs and lows menu-wise\u201d because on Britt\u2019s recco, we did in fact order the whole menu! Including every dessert, and too many cocktails for a Thursday. Highs fried yuba tartlette (MINUS the white truffle so only $26) steak frites (emphasis on the frites) Lows leeks (undercooked) vol au vent (loved the pastry and lobster but thought the sweetbreads were giving rubber?) tres leches dessert (they brought a shot of rum with it and then poured the whole thing on it and it was literally horrid. felt so fun when they did it and then we all ate a bite and were like omg nooooo. i have video proof. The place really feels like a French bistro, which i love. They\u2019re even like, kind of gruff. And the lighting is good but not perfect? I can tell they\u2019ve been to Bistrot Paul Bert is all I\u2019m saying OK. Not perfect! Really pricey! But def Hit List for me, and I have faith it will get better in time. Oh also - worth noting that I walked by Ha\u2019s Snack Bar after and though it was later at night, I could have walked right in, lots of space. Ha\u2019s Snack Bar - Sonal This was my second real visit here, first was way back when it opened, and I think it wasn\u2019t quite dialed in right away. 1.5 was when I walked in to say hi to solo dining Molly and had a bite of her vol au vent. This time I randomly texted Willa because I was downtown and knew she\u2019d be trying to walk in. I\u2019m glad my experiences of getting here have been kind of spontaneous and low-key because I think that\u2019s the vibe Ha\u2019s is aiming for, despite the hype. Willa showed up 4:45ish, and was first in line. Everyone who was waiting pretty much got seated at 5:30 I think? Maybe a few things a bit toooo \u201ccasual walk-in\u201d like they\u2019ve taken out the table and one of the seating options is... Standing... Around a high top. But man, you can still eat a whole meal here and everything was a banger. Loved our three toasts equally, and the eggs mayo with Maggi, and the p\u00e2t\u00e9 chaud, the squid ink risotto kind of sweet from Chinese bacon. Desserts were less bangy but like a gentle goodbye. Ramen by Ra - Will Man this place is cute. Tiny, tiny, tiny. Six seats, and you have to reserve them at least two weeks out. The whole process of eating here is a touch annoying but you almost forget the annoyance after waiting for two/three weeks. They release reservations on the 1st and 15th of every month for the following two weeks (res on the 1st of dec are for the 15-31 of dec), and you also preorder all of your food when you make your reservation. All that said, it\u2019s tucked in this really sunny cute spot on 1st street and 1st ave, and the breakfast ramens are all really good. She does something interesting which is that instead of making different broths, she uses these really intense oils to differentiate the bowls. I liked the steak and eggs bowl that has this chimichurri oil--the bacon egg and cheese bowl sorta got heavy after a little while. Raf\u2019s - Hillary I think this is the hottest and best power lunch scene downtown?! It was packed, great vibes, lots of people talking to different tables, and food was great and actually lunch-y. We had tuna tartare, ni\u00e7oise, and baked eggs amatriciana. A Friday 2pm lunch meeting of dreams tbh. Locanda Vini & Olii - Jonathan When I used to live around the corner from this place I would walk by on cold nights and see people sitting at the tiny bar (the old front desk from when it was a pharmacy) and think: that looks so cozy. I want to sit at that bar. And I did just that on Friday. I remember an old Grubstreet piece from a couple years ago saying that LaRina felt like being dropped into a small-town Italian trattoria, but Locanda\u2019s vibe in that department has them beat by a mile. At our corner of the bar there were way more Italian convos happening than English, both among the other people sitting there and the staff to the point where I almost wanted to apologize for ordering in English (complimentary). I got butternut squash ravioli and some eggplant parm and it was good but this is a vibes first place, and if I still lived around the corner I\u2019d be here all the time. Stars - Bryan People were waiting outside a wine bar at 3:58pm on a Tuesday in 30\u00b0 weather for the chance to eat an $8 deviled egg. Not a good use of your money. But this is a very cute place, so you probably won\u2019t care. Would like to be a regular here. So charming, and such a massive wine list for such a tiny bar. Food is very good and portioned for American Girl Dolls. That\u2019s A Nice Touch spotlights a moment we realized we were being charmed against our will. Toriya - Carlo Nice touch alert! When they drop the check, they\u2019ll offer you a chance to win your meal for free if you play this game where you have to stop this timer on a specific number. I\u2019ve played it twice and want to keep going back so I can win! Pic of game rules below: For more restaurant intel, subscribe to our real newsletter and follow us on Instagram and TikTok .

    "text": "SOFREH SOFREH /s\u014dfre/ Our philosophy is simple - food should be authentic, well crafted, and delicious. We practice this in everything we create, from our homemade yogurts to our fresh-baked breads. As for the restaurant\u2019s name? Traditionally, the Sofreh is a term for an iconic Persian fabric that served as the backdrop for seasonal feasts and celebrations. Over time, the term itself has taken on a larger cultural significance: it refers to a gathering, a sharing, a place for family and friends to come together. You\u2019re welcome to meet us there. \u201cIn her restaurant d\u00e9but, Nasim Alikhani\u2019s front-of-house style seems just as intuitive as her interpretations of a cuisine sorely underrepresented in the city.\u201d The New Yorker By Hannah Goldfield Food is the language through which Nasim Alikhani best knows how to express herself. Her earliest and fondest memories are of staying indoors during the summer as a child, preparing foods and making jams and pickles with her mother. Coming from a tradition of strong women who are great cooks, she began cooking for large gatherings and parties at a young age. During law school while studying to be a judge, she found that her true passion was cooking for friends and classmates. It took Nasim twenty five years to realize her dream of opening a restaurant. In that time, she worked in various professions unrelated to food, did some ad-hoc catering, attended the International Culinary Center, interned in restaurants, and most difficult of all, pleased her twins' discerning palates. Finally, in the summer of 2018, at 59, she opened Sofreh to acclaim. HONEST FOOD MADE WITH LOVE \u201crelaxed, with a modern, cosmopolitan attitude.\u201d The New York Times 10 of the Best New N.Y.C. Restaurants By Pete Wells At Sofreh we sought to interpret the welcoming, cozy atmosphere of traditional Persian homes in a bright and minimalist setting. Creative director & interior designer Rozhia Tabnak has crafted a location that demonstrates the ways in which contemporary design can be a complement to hospitality, not in competition with it. The dining room is uncluttered and modern, with subtle allegorical touches that cleverly nod to the heritage of both Ms. Alikhani and the food she creates.",

Under the direction of fourth-generation restaurateur Gero Fasano , with execution by Chef Nicola Fedeli , the restaurant honors the Fasano family\u2019s heritage in Northern Italian cuisine through attentive service, thoughtful technique, and enduring style. The experience unfolds across two distinct settings. The Main Dining Room offers a more formal atmosphere, where traditional hospitality and authentic Milanese cuisine meet in a timeless space designed by architect Isay Weinfeld . Elegant table settings and measured service define the room, created for guests seeking a classic fine-dining experience. At the front of the restaurant, Fasano Bar presents a more relaxed interpretation of the Fasano spirit. Warmed by wood and low light, the bar features a curated selection of cocktails and Italian dishes crafted to complement the aperitivo tradition. Ideal before or after dinner, Fasano Bar offers an inviting setting for conversation and a more informal evening at the restaurant. Together, the two spaces create a complete dining destination in the heart of Midtown Manhattan, accommodating different moods while remaining rooted in the same commitment to quality and hospitality.

    "text": "About \u2014 Golden Ratio 0 Golden Ratio is a cocktail bar in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, where the artistry of mixology meets the principles of balance, harmony, and interconnectedness found in nature. Guided by the belief that nature builds nothing at random , the bar explores the relationship between precision and transformation \u2014 how things begin imperfect and evolve toward balance through intention and time. It finds beauty in the spontaneous order of nature, where what feels instinctive is often the result of quiet design. Each drink reflects that dialogue between the organic and the intentional, between what is measured and what is felt. Golden Ratio is the latest project from Redwood Hospitality, the team behind Michelin-starred Oxalis (temporarily closed) , Place des F\u00eates, Cafe Mado, and Laurel Bakery. Known for creating experiences defined by craftsmanship, warmth, and innovation, Redwood continues to shape a distinct hospitality culture rooted in excellence, sustainability, and community.

I signed up for their \"Premium\" tier for my wife\u2019s birthday, and after digging into the actual user experience and the Dorsia Terms of Use , I realized this isn't hospitality; it\u2019s a predatory financial trap. TL;DR: Dorsia takes a $5k loan from you, gives it back in expiring monthly \"Fun Coupons,\" and tells you the only way to get a refund is to die. 1. Your $5,000 is an Interest-Free Loan (The \"Fun Coupon\" Scam) Dorsia markets an elevated experience, but their business model is built on holding your cash to pad their own accounts. When you prepay for the Premium tier, they convert your cash into \"Fun Coupons.\" Here is the reality of your $5,000: The Drip Feed: You cannot use your $5,000 at once. It is distributed back to you to use in monthly installments. The Expiration: Per their Terms of Use , these Fun Coupons carry a \"use it or lose it\" policy. If you don't book a table through them within their specific timeframe, your own money expires. The Interest: While you are waiting for your \"allowance\" of coupons to be deposited, Dorsia is holding onto your thousands of dollars and benefiting from that capital while you have zero access to it. 2. The Torrisi Bait-and-Switch I joined for Torrisi. Once they had my $5,000, I discovered that the inventory is a moving target and have effectively paywalled the most sought-after NYC tables behind a staggering $25,000 \"Premium Plus\" tier. This isn't exclusivity; it\u2019s a bait-and-switch. You pay for a \"Premium\" level only to find the goalposts have been moved another $20,000 away. 3. The Litigious \"Death or Disability\" Clause Dorsia\u2019s management is virtually impossible to reach for a human conversation. When you do get a response, it is a legal template. They rely on Section 3.3 of their Terms of Use , which is one of the most anti-consumer clauses I've ever seen in the hospitality industry: \"Fees are nonrefundable, except in extremely limited circumstances such as disability or death .\" Think about that. If you are unhappy with the service, or if they change the availability of the restaurants you joined for, their legal stance is that you must literally die or become disabled to get a refund of your membership fee. 4. Zero Accountability (No Support or Maintenance) You might think $5,000 buys you a concierge, but their terms tell a different story. In the fine print of the Terms of Use , Dorsia explicitly states that they have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance. Even worse, they admit they have no control over the restaurants. If a restaurant overrides your \"confirmed\" booking at the last minute, Dorsia takes zero responsibility. They take your money upfront but offer zero protection if the actual \"service\" fails on your important night. 5. Final Verdict: A Scam of a Business Dorsia is a concierge service that acts like a loan shark . They take your money, restrict how you spend it, let it expire if you aren't active enough, and then threaten you with \"Death or Disability\" clauses if you ask for your money back. For anyone searching for Dorsia App reviews or Dorsia NYC feedback : Save your money. The \"Fun Coupons\" are a trap, and the management team is a ghost ship. You are better off using Resy, Amex Global Dining, or just showing up at the bar. #Dorsia #DorsiaNYC #DorsiaReview #Torrisi #NYCFoodie #DorsiaApp #ConsumerAlert #NYCRestaurants Everything I ate in NYC in 5 days from Canada u/Breezy8081 \u2022 Everything I ate in NYC in 5 days from Canada Review Two Cheese Slices from Rosario\u2019s in Astoria - an underrated contender for best slice in the City u/ZenghisZan \u2022 Two Cheese Slices from Rosario\u2019s in Astoria - an underrated contender for best slice in the City Photo Created Aug 7, 2014 Public Anyone can view, post, and comment to this community 273K 4K r/FoodNYC Rules 1 Link required 2 Be friendly 3 No hate, flamewars, rude comments, etc 4 Food must be either a product, dish served by restaurant, or any other food facility.

For anyone searching for Dorsia App reviews or Dorsia NYC feedback : Save your money. The \"Fun Coupons\" are a trap, and the management team is a ghost ship.

I signed up for their \"Premium\" tier for my wife\u2019s birthday, and after digging into the actual user experience and the Dorsia Terms of Use , I realized this isn't hospitality; it\u2019s a predatory financial trap. TL;DR: Dorsia takes a $5k loan from you, gives it back in expiring monthly \"Fun Coupons,\" and tells you the only way to get a refund is to die. 1. Your $5,000 is an Interest-Free Loan (The \"Fun Coupon\" Scam) Dorsia markets an elevated experience, but their business model is built on holding your cash to pad their own accounts. When you prepay for the Premium tier, they convert your cash into \"Fun Coupons.\" Here is the reality of your $5,000: The Drip Feed: You cannot use your $5,000 at once. It is distributed back to you to use in monthly installments. The Expiration: Per their Terms of Use , these Fun Coupons carry a \"use it or lose it\" policy. If you don't book a table through them within their specific timeframe, your own money expires. The Interest: While you are waiting for your \"allowance\" of coupons to be deposited, Dorsia is holding onto your thousands of dollars and benefiting from that capital while you have zero access to it. 2. The Torrisi Bait-and-Switch I joined for Torrisi. Once they had my $5,000, I discovered that the inventory is a moving target and have effectively paywalled the most sought-after NYC tables behind a staggering $25,000 \"Premium Plus\" tier. This isn't exclusivity; it\u2019s a bait-and-switch. You pay for a \"Premium\" level only to find the goalposts have been moved another $20,000 away. 3. The Litigious \"Death or Disability\" Clause Dorsia\u2019s management is virtually impossible to reach for a human conversation. When you do get a response, it is a legal template. They rely on Section 3.3 of their Terms of Use , which is one of the most anti-consumer clauses I've ever seen in the hospitality industry: \"Fees are nonrefundable, except in extremely limited circumstances such as disability or death .\" Think about that. If you are unhappy with the service, or if they change the availability of the restaurants you joined for, their legal stance is that you must literally die or become disabled to get a refund of your membership fee. 4. Zero Accountability (No Support or Maintenance) You might think $5,000 buys you a concierge, but their terms tell a different story. In the fine print of the Terms of Use , Dorsia explicitly states that they have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance. Even worse, they admit they have no control over the restaurants. If a restaurant overrides your \"confirmed\" booking at the last minute, Dorsia takes zero responsibility. They take your money upfront but offer zero protection if the actual \"service\" fails on your important night. 5. Final Verdict: A Scam of a Business Dorsia is a concierge service that acts like a loan shark . They take your money, restrict how you spend it, let it expire if you aren't active enough, and then threaten you with \"Death or Disability\" clauses if you ask for your money back. For anyone searching for Dorsia App reviews or Dorsia NYC feedback : Save your money. The \"Fun Coupons\" are a trap, and the management team is a ghost ship.

Our core values guide our actions and we aim to empower our customers, team members and partners to be a positive force on the food system. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a transparent supply network, why we cook from scratch, and why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a community of people who believe in the power of real food. Our Story We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the business of feeding people, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out to change what that means We started sweetgreen as three college students who were simply looking for a healthier way to eat. When we were in school, there were two choices: food that was slow, expensive, and fresh\u00e2\u0080\u0094or fast, cheap, and unhealthy. We saw an opportunity to create a business where quality was never sacrificed for convenience.\u00c2 On August 1st 2007, two months after graduating, we opened sweetgreen in Washington DC, and served our first customers with a vision to reimagine fast food. Learn more \u00e2\u0086\u0092 Sustainability We believe that climate change is the defining challenge of our generation We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to becoming carbon neutral by the end of 2027. In a world where the long- and short-term effects of climate change pose major challenges for farmers, the need for regenerative food systems has never been more important. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a promise to do more for the planet, by taking less. Our plant-forward menu means that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already on average 30% less carbon intensive than the average American meal.

Our goal is to support farmers and producers who participate in regenerative practices\u00e2\u0080\u0094ones that give more to the land than they take away. flip Menu Development flip We calculate an accurate carbon footprint for each of our menu items by commissioning carbon assessments of our specific suppliers.

We use this data to direct our menu and adjust as needed. flip Restaurants flip We optimize our building materials from construction to furniture, investing in clean energy, and industrial equipment to make a minimal impact.

Please inquire with us. Get Directions Get Directions It all started with what seemed like a simple decision. Sandro\u2019s father gave him the ultimatum of either continuing his studies or going to work. He started washing dishes and peeling potatoes, working his way up in the kitchen of Ristorante Cacciani ( Frascati \u2013 Rome). On his 17th birthday he became sous chef to the renowned Franco Carbonari. Just a few days short of his 21st birthday in 1968, he won a first prize at the prestigious Circolo della Stampa in Milan. In presenting him with his award, the dean of Italian food critics, Vincenzo Buonassisi said, \"given the opportunity, you will, one day, bring a whole new dimension to the thousand year old tradition of Italian cooking.\" After working at Cacciani, Sandro was ready to open his first restaurant, D'Artagnan, named in memory of the great Dumas hero who, in one of the chapters of the The Three Musketeers, outlined a dessert recipe with 20 pounds of ingredients and a quart of liquor. D'Artagnan was a success, featuring a variety of innovative dishes that were to become Sandro signatures: risotto with strawberries, salads made with fried tulips, penne with a sauce of vodka. He also excelled with the more familiar presentations of roast meats and fowl, homemade pastas and soups. The olive oils were seasoned as were the vinegars and the fiery grappas - with garlic, rosemary, chili peppers, oranges, peaches, bananas and raspberries. In 1984 while attending the GRI (Gruppo Ristatori Italiani) convention in Parma, Italy, Tony May, GRI's chairman, owner of San Domenico NY and a long-time friend, offered Sandro an opportunity to open a restaurant in New York City. The original Sandro's, which opened in 1985, was an instant success, introducing both Sandro and authentic Italian cuisine to New York City. For seven years, Sandro drew people to his restaurant with dishes then unheard of to New Yorkers. USA Today considered Sandro\u2019s to be one of the top 10 new restaurants in America. When Sandro's closed in 1992, Sandro consulted for restaurants like Nello\u2019s (NYC),Coco Pazzo (Chicago),il Buco (NYC), and Sapore Di Mare (Hamptons). He moved to the Caribbean where he opened an eponymous restaurant and enjoyed the island life with his family. After a hurricane destroyed the restaurant, he returned to New York to open Sandro's on Ninth Avenue at 22nd Street. In the spring of 2007, Sandro came full circle with the opening of his fourth restaurant on East 81st Street. The restaurant, serving Sandro's signature Roman-style cuisine, is a favorite to both New Yorkers and Italian food lovers everywhere. After making it through the Covid pandemic of 2020, Sandro's on East 81st street closed in January of 2022 because of non-covid related issues. Wanting to stay on the Upper East Side, Sandro's moved a mere five blocks away to East 86th street in July of 2022. Keeping the same staff and menu from East 81st street, the only change here was the location. \"For the worlds No. 1 amatriciana, no plane is required.

Please inquire with us. Get Directions Get Directions It all started with what seemed like a simple decision. Sandro\u2019s father gave him the ultimatum of either continuing his studies or going to work. He started washing dishes and peeling potatoes, working his way up in the kitchen of Ristorante Cacciani ( Frascati \u2013 Rome). On his 17th birthday he became sous chef to the renowned Franco Carbonari. Just a few days short of his 21st birthday in 1968, he won a first prize at the prestigious Circolo della Stampa in Milan. In presenting him with his award, the dean of Italian food critics, Vincenzo Buonassisi said, \"given the opportunity, you will, one day, bring a whole new dimension to the thousand year old tradition of Italian cooking.\" After working at Cacciani, Sandro was ready to open his first restaurant, D'Artagnan, named in memory of the great Dumas hero who, in one of the chapters of the The Three Musketeers, outlined a dessert recipe with 20 pounds of ingredients and a quart of liquor. D'Artagnan was a success, featuring a variety of innovative dishes that were to become Sandro signatures: risotto with strawberries, salads made with fried tulips, penne with a sauce of vodka. He also excelled with the more familiar presentations of roast meats and fowl, homemade pastas and soups. The olive oils were seasoned as were the vinegars and the fiery grappas - with garlic, rosemary, chili peppers, oranges, peaches, bananas and raspberries. In 1984 while attending the GRI (Gruppo Ristatori Italiani) convention in Parma, Italy, Tony May, GRI's chairman, owner of San Domenico NY and a long-time friend, offered Sandro an opportunity to open a restaurant in New York City. The original Sandro's, which opened in 1985, was an instant success, introducing both Sandro and authentic Italian cuisine to New York City. For seven years, Sandro drew people to his restaurant with dishes then unheard of to New Yorkers. USA Today considered Sandro\u2019s to be one of the top 10 new restaurants in America. When Sandro's closed in 1992, Sandro consulted for restaurants like Nello\u2019s (NYC),Coco Pazzo (Chicago),il Buco (NYC), and Sapore Di Mare (Hamptons). He moved to the Caribbean where he opened an eponymous restaurant and enjoyed the island life with his family. After a hurricane destroyed the restaurant, he returned to New York to open Sandro's on Ninth Avenue at 22nd Street. In the spring of 2007, Sandro came full circle with the opening of his fourth restaurant on East 81st Street. The restaurant, serving Sandro's signature Roman-style cuisine, is a favorite to both New Yorkers and Italian food lovers everywhere. After making it through the Covid pandemic of 2020, Sandro's on East 81st street closed in January of 2022 because of non-covid related issues. Wanting to stay on the Upper East Side, Sandro's moved a mere five blocks away to East 86th street in July of 2022. Keeping the same staff and menu from East 81st street, the only change here was the location. \"For the worlds No. 1 amatriciana, no plane is required. I need risk only a cab ride to East 81st street in Manhattan to my currently favorite hometown Italian restaurant, Sandro\u2019s, where the chef-owner cooks as the romans would like to.\" - Mimi Sheraton, NEW YORK TIMES \"The food at Sandro\u2019s, a loud trattoria led by its unpredictable chef can make you weep with joy.\" - Alan Richman, BLOOMBERG MARKET \"But he (Sandro Fioriti) belongs to an older breed, embattled but not yet extinct.\" - Joshua David Stein, MANHATTAN MAGAZINE \"But his latest\u2014a slim, simple, all-white spot\u2014is pure Fioriti. Our bucatini all\u2019Amatriciana was a fine balance of thick, chewy pasta and piquant tomato sauce, dense with chubby nibs of pancetta. Spaghetti al\u2019 limone was a tangy explosion of citrus tempered by sweet cream.\" - Tony, TIME OUT NEW YORK \"I remember too vividly the glory days of my own Italian innocence in 1985, when Sandro Fioriti first thrilled us with pungent sea urchin ravioli, lemon spaghetti and his exquisite fried calamaretti. Pan seared cuttle fish combines brilliantly with slivers of artichoke\" - Gael Green, BITE: MY JOURNAL \"A well known chef in Italy for more than 25 years, Fioriti\u2019s interests extend well beyond cooking and a predilection for Roman-style dishes.\" - Diners club 48 of our countrys best chefs 1995 \"That sprawling veal Milanese with breading startlingly crisp, laughs at the one I had in Milan.\" - Steve Cuozzo, NEW YORK POST \"Where restaurant critics go when they're spending their own money\" - John F, Mariani, ESQUIRE \"Sandro\u2019s brings Rome home\" - Pascale Le Draoulec, NEW YORK DAILY NEWS \"When not in Rome, Sandro\u2019s is the next best thing\" - Moira Hodgson, NEW YORK OBSERVER \"WINNER FOR MOST ARTISTIC ARTICHOKES\" - VILLAGE VOICE, 2001 \"Chef-owner Sandro Fioriti produces Roman-style and pan-Italian specialties with just enough spin to entice both serious eater and trendier diner.\" - Mimi Sheraton, DEPARTURES MAGAZINE \"What you will find in a long, narrow store front space, is well cooked Italian food, with an accent on the Roman \u2013 which, frankly, is all to the good.\" - Linda Perney, NEWSDAY Sandro's Restaurant is committed to the accessibility and usability of its website, https://www.sandrosrestaurant.com/ , for all people with disabilities.

DINEX COOKIE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT Last updated: 07/20/2024 We employ the use of cookie technology and web beacons throughout our site, to allow you to move more quickly and securely through our pages. Along with a registration process that uses data encryption, we offer consistently secure, efficient online sessions that allow you to validate your subscription, access your account and retain some personal settings so you can read what you want, the way that you want it. And this is all made possible by cookie technology. Below you'll find information describing our specific use of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production process and have enabled us to better serve you. WHAT'S A COOKIE? A cookie is a small text file that's sent to your computer or other device by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Contrary to what you might read elsewhere, cookies cannot get information from your hard drive against your will, destroy files, send you viruses, etc. An important point: Cookies can only contain as much information as you disclose to the site that sent it to you! In our case, that means any information included in your subscription form or that you input during the customization of our site. WHY DO YOU USE COOKIES? We use cookies for basic reasons: To allow you to move more quickly and securely through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter our site, for example, we use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies, check our database to verify your subscription and log the Internet protocol (IP) that your session originates from. A cookie is then temporarily \"set\" within your browser to allow you to proceed -- without having to ask you for your User Name and Password with each subsequent page you request. Without cookie technology, we wouldn't be able to offer you convenient features such as the ability to store your User Name and Password and save settings for your customized experience. SO WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME? Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies: Faster, more secure access: So we don't have to ask you to identify yourself with each new page requested. We can also deliver you customized information and store your settings more efficiently. Better information: We want to give you features and services that you're interested in. By monitoring popular -- and not-so-popular -- features in an aggregate manner, we can better serve your needs. SO DO YOU TRACK MY USAGE PATTERNS USING COOKIES? We track the usage of various features within our sites on an aggregate basis and report this to advertisers. However, we do not track your usage or other personal information in any individually identified way. Some web browsers may transmit \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals to websites visited by the user. Our information collection and disclosure practices will continue to apply as described in this policy, regardless of any \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals that are sent by certain browsers. WILL THE COOKIES YOU SEND ME GO AWAY? Some of the cookies we use are automatically deleted from your hard drive after the end of the browser session (\u201csession cookies\u201d). We also use cookies that remain on your hard drive for a certain period of time (between one day and thirty days depending on the cookie) after the browser session. \u201cPersistent cookies\" are stored on your hard drive and will be deleted by the browser after the given time. You are, of course, free to clear any and all cookies from your hard drive any time you wish. Just search your system for any files named cookie.txt or similar and delete them at your discretion. SO SHOULD I SURF YOUR SITE WITH MY BROWSER'S COOKIE-ALERT FEATURE ACTIVATED? We'd recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the site for a day with it on so you can see our cookies firsthand if you wish. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience here. And because we rely on cookies throughout our site, you might find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you'll encounter. Many of our cookies last only for 12 hours, so you'll see them every day. HOW CAN I AMEND MY COOKIE PREFERENCES? You can configure your browser settings to accept or reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have already been set. Every browser is different, so check the \"Help\" menu of your browser to learn about and to change your cookie preferences. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although you may not be able to use certain features on our site. In addition, a number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit web sites anonymously. The site www.allaboutcookies.org includes instructions for managing cookies on many commonly used browses. DO YOU USE THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING COOKIES? When you visit our site, you may receive cookies that are set by third parties. We use third party retargeting and remarketing features on our website. These technologies allow us to address internet users who previously visited the site by personalized advertising on our partners' websites. For this purpose, the retargeting or remarketing provider will store a cookie on your hard drive. Because cookies do not contain or access any personal information, we also allow third parties, like ad networks and servers, to serve customized ads to you. As a result, third parties may access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or mobile phone. We do not have access to information collected by these third parties, nor does this Cookie Disclosure Statement or our Privacy Policy govern the use of third party cookies or similar technology. If you do not wish to receive these tailored advertisements, you may visit the following pages to opt-out: Google Criteo NAI Opt Out Tool DO PLUG-INS ON OUR SITE STORE COOKIES? When you access our site, the plug-in provider may store a cookie in your browser. We have no control over the scope of the data collected by the provider by means of the plug-in.

Wontons here are the best in the area. They're not the largest nor the cheapest. But in terms of pure quality of product and savoriness, they are better than anything in downtown. Noodle Village and HK Wonton House are good, but these are better. The shrimp is plump and fresh, the pork is incredibly savory and perfectly balanced with the light soup. Lei G. 4/24/16 When I was served, it was worth. The wontons, with their mixture of pork and big chunks of shrimp, were among the best I've had in the city. It makes you realize how terrible a facisimile people are getting in the slimy, tiny \"wontons\" of American Chinese restaurants. The noodles were properly chewy and there was a nice ring of fat on the roast pork. Overall, very impressive, and I'm sure there's more to discover here. Jon S. 4/15/16 READ MORE",

Wontons here are the best in the area. They're not the largest nor the cheapest. But in terms of pure quality of product and savoriness, they are better than anything in downtown. Noodle Village and HK Wonton House are good, but these are better. The shrimp is plump and fresh, the pork is incredibly savory and perfectly balanced with the light soup. Lei G. 4/24/16 When I was served, it was worth. The wontons, with their mixture of pork and big chunks of shrimp, were among the best I've had in the city. It makes you realize how terrible a facisimile people are getting in the slimy, tiny \"wontons\" of American Chinese restaurants. The noodles were properly chewy and there was a nice ring of fat on the roast pork. Overall, very impressive, and I'm sure there's more to discover here. Jon S. 4/15/16 READ MORE",

    "text": "French Restaurant & Wine Bar Midtown - Benoit New York Restaurant Benoit is all about conviviality, memories, and a shared pleasure around the table. It shows a certain lifestyle and tradition, that both have very bright futures. Alain Ducasse Paris bistro meets New York restaurant Benoit New York is a contemporary French bistro by Alain Ducasse. In August 2016, Alain Ducasse transformed the original Benoit into a more modern 21st century dining destination. While the updated look still retains traditional French bistro elements, such as the signature red velvet banquettes, the lighter color palette and brand new Wine Bar bring a breath of fresh air to the heart of Midtown Manhattan. + - Parisian bistro since 1912 Benoit New York opened in 2008 a few steps away from Fifth Avenue and Central Park, in the space formerly occupied by La C\u00f4te Basque. The bistro echoes the original Benoit in Paris, which first opened its doors in 1912 and became part of Alain Ducasse Entreprise in 2005. In the city's dynamic urban environment, guests can enjoy a quintessential Parisian bistro experience which has been recreated and modernized. Wine Bar Benoit's new Wine Bar is a vibrant space for guests to learn, indulge and interact, driving the dynamic nature of the restaurant's overall beverage program. Through weekly and monthly programming, our team of Sommeliers sheds light on selections from Old Europe and the New World. Innovative offerings include a rotation of original wine, served through coravin device to offer the upmost quality of service. + - A Dynamic Beverage Program Like any good French restaurant, wine is at the heart of Benoit New York. The list features more than 900 references, from iconic French producers to domestic wines, with a particular focus on selections from the East Coast. Since reopening in August 2016, Benoit continues to offer a dynamic and approachable wine program that is complementary to the restaurant's classic yet modern cuisine. Traditional and Contemporary Design In collaboration with New York based Dekar Design, Alain Ducasse reimagined Benoit as a classic French restaurant with a more inviting, residential feel and a modern new look. Whites, grays and blues create a warmer yet airier d\u00e9cor and atmosphere while the white washed wood paneled walls, vintage lights from a Paris flea market and stone mantel fireplace all contribute to Benoit's revitalized identity as an authentic Parisian bistro with a New York sensibility. The redesigned entrance now boasts an intimate lounge space, complete with a fireplace and antique club chairs from Alain Ducasse's personal collection. Signature brass elements and red accents from the original Benoit remain in the main dining room, which has nonetheless been refreshed with brighter walls, large mirrors and vintage swing arm sconces, creating a more open space. The once black-and-white bar has undergone a complete transformation, fusing the inside with the outside with vintage porch lights, light gray wood paneling, colorful cement tiled floors and plaster wallpaper, bringing life and texture to the space. Private Dining Benoit New York boasts four private dining rooms, located directly above the restaurant on the second floor and accessible through a private entrance. Les Salons are three exquisitely designed rooms named after streets leading to Benoit in Paris: Saint-Martin, H\u00f4tel de Ville and Rivoli. Ideal for quick business lunches, holiday parties and more, their authentic French d\u00e9cor is reminiscent of traditional Parisian restaurants. L'Officine is an intimate room set in an original antique 19th Century apothecary from Bordeaux, brought over by boat and very dear to Alain Ducasse. A perfect setting for guests looking for a unique culinary experience that will transport you to Paris. MORE INFORMATION Lucile Plaza, Executive Chef Benoit Bistro, the iconic French destination by Alain Ducasse, proudly highlights the culinary leadership of Chef Lucile Plaza, whose career reflects a seamless blend of classical French tradition and the vibrant energy of New York City. Raised in the suburbs of East Paris and influenced by her dual French-Spanish heritage, Chef Lucile began her culinary path early, training at \u00c9cole H\u00f4teli\u00e8re de Paris \u2013 CFA M\u00e9d\u00e9ric and honing her craft in some of Paris\u2019 most esteemed Michelin-starred kitchens. She joined Benoit New York in 2014, where she developed her voice within a collaborative, female-led kitchen before leading the culinary program at Le Coq Rico, earning widespread national and international acclaim\u2014particularly for what many critics hailed as the finest poultry dishes in the United States. Returning to the Alain Ducasse family at Benoit in 2020, Chef Lucile has been recognized by New York Magazine , Forbes , Wine Spectator , and The Daily Beast for her elegant, comforting approach to French cuisine, marrying classical technique with modern sensibility and ensuring Benoit\u2019s continued standing as a cornerstone of French-American culinary excellence.",

When she was to be married, the walnut tree was cut down and with the wood, as a symbol of happiness and prosperity, her nuptial bed was made. From the nuts, then as today, a precious elixir was made; the Nocello , a characteristic liqueur which adorned the table of Princes and Kings .

Lee 9.8 Tatiana is the highest-rated restaurant in NYC Sonal Shah May 21, 2024 Reserve a Table Website Directions Save To A List Perfect for Special Occasions Date Nights Impressing Out of Towners Birthdays A single bite of the short rib pastrami suya\u2014which is brined in Jewish deli spices before marinating in Nigerian ones, then braised for hours\u2014is all we needed to know that Tatiana has something special. We keep returning to the Lincoln Center restaurant (one of our Best New Restaurants of 2023 ) for another round, even if it means lining up at 4:30pm for a table. Each time, the suya tastes somehow better than we remembered. Once you make it inside this difficult to reserve corner of the David Geffen Hall, it\u2019s like being a VIP guest at the city\u2019s hottest club. Tatiana glows blue and purple under puffy cloud chandeliers, glitters behind chain-link curtains, and blasts old-school hip hop and R&B. It's a rare fine dining spot with immaculate flow, where a server will refold your napkin the second you step away from your seat, and might also drop a little dance move while they're at it. We like to think of Tatiana as the restaurant equivalent of \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\" with each exceptional dish making a statement about what it means to be from New York. Even if you miss a few references, the food still makes you want to throw a lighter in the air. Sorry, we're tossing around a lot of metaphors here\u2014but so is Tatiana. photo credit: David A. Lee photo credit: Adrian Gaut photo credit: David A. Lee Pause Unmute The menu is tight with no skips: it\u2019s packed with spins on NYC classics (like that pastrami suya) and draws from the celebrity chef Kwame Onwuachi\u2019s Bronx upbringing, as well as his Nigerian and Creole roots. The braised oxtails, which take days to prepare, involve a collagen-rich broth of boiled-down chicken feet. The version at your favorite local Jamaican counter spot will never quite hit the same way. Steaming curried goat patties flake apart into shards of crimped, blistered dough, perfect for chasing aioli\u2014bright with Caribbean green seasoning\u2014and sweet mango chutney around the plate. Other familiar but fresh takes include a mushroomy riff on Chinese takeout, and even a nod to the Cosmic brownies at corner bodegas. There are a few dishes we wouldn't rush to order again (a truffle chopped cheese, a pricey seafood boil)\u2014but this place is so good, those aren't even on the menu anymore. Get all the hits, and then as many of the B-sides as you can: berbere-spiced lamb with black-bean hummus, head-on shrimp served with brioche toast, rum-soaked cake with gooseberries. Then, pretend it\u2019s your birthday to score the off-menu jello shots, which are more pretty than boozy. Your server knows what's up, but as they hand over a plate of four stained glass-like cubes dusted with gold, they'll wink right back at you. How to get into Tatiana Reservations are released four weeks in advance at 12pm. If you can't snag one of those, try the six-seat bar (available to parties of two), or put your name down for a no-show table. Show up by 4:30 if you want an early seating, or get a drink in the lobby of David Geffen Hall while you wait for a later table. RESERVE A TABLE Food Rundown Hamachi Escovitch This smaller plate of firm, raw hamachi starts the meal off on a high note, with the gingery buzz of escovitch melding seamlessly with orange carrot nage (a broth-like French sauce). It's sweet, sour, and a little spicy with marinated peppers\u2014and a good way to balance out the meatier things you'll be eating next. photo credit: David A. Lee Honeynut Piri Piri Salad We'd say that fish-avoiders could get this salad instead of the hamachi escovitch, but there are really no \"instead ofs\" at Tatiana. Seasonal grapes and other crisp, fruity bites sit in a bright, delicious pool of piri piri-honeynut squash velout\u00e9. photo credit: Evan Sung Curried Goat Patties The goat curry inside these patties is delicious, but we could eat just the corners of these hot, blistered beauties for days. Also pictured: Tatiana's house hot pepper sauce, which you should hoard for the duration of your meal. photo credit: David A. Lee Short Rib Pastrami Suya If for some reason you\u2019re only getting one thing at Tatiana, it should be this. The Wagyu short rib practically falls apart when you look at it, and it comes with caraway coco bread and a heap of incredibly tender braised red cabbage. photo credit: David A. Lee Braised Oxtails Between the pastrami suya and the braised oxtails, it's a tough competition. Get both if you can. Swimming in a dark brown, sticky goo, these tender cuts of meat are simultaneously comforting and startlingly delicious, with sweet notes from spices like bay and cinnamon. photo credit: Evan Sung Mom Duke\u2019s Shrimp These huge, head-on shrimp are swimming in creole butter and served with brioche, sliced as thick as Texas toast. They're great, though we'd prioritize the meatier dishes if you have to. photo credit: David A. Lee Take-Out Mushrooms Tatiana's menu isn't quite as exciting for vegetarians, but this Chinese takout-inspired, mixed-mushroom dish is a solid option. The scallion pancakes are our favorite part, and you should dab each piece with plum sauce and a shred of pickled ginger before making a little bite. photo credit: David Lee Bodega Special If you grew up eating packaged snacks from bodegas, this one might just make you cry in a good way. It\u2019s a cosmic brownie with powdered donut ice cream, but it got older and started eating at fancy restaurants.

Kwame's big sister looked after him while their mother worked as a chef in New York City. As the loving caretaker of his early food-wishes and dreams, Tatiana serves as the inspiration for this restaurant, and will forever hold a special place in Kwame's heart. With an upbringing rooted in and around the Bronx and the old neighborhood of San Juan Hill, there was no shortage of culinary inspiration for Chef Kwame to draw from: Italian bakeries, Chinese takeout, Caribbean roti shops, corner stores and local bodegas \u2013 which is why Tatiana's menu reflects those proud and diverse origins, served with equal measures of care and love. Tatiana is a tribute to the neighborhoods of Chef Kwame's youth These fond memories \u2013 steeped in a melting pot of New York City's diverse culinary influences \u2013 serve as the foundation of Tatiana's \"story\" \u2013 one written in the romance language of food, inspired by his Afro- Caribbean-by-way-of-the-Bronx heritage. And while Kwame's first love is most certainly cooking, that love extends beyond the kitchen and into the community, where he nourishes local causes with philanthropic contributions \u2013 not only to honor and nurture his roots, but to inspire the next generation of talented chefs to do the same. Tatiana Gives Back \"Restaurants are supposed to be the cornerstone of the community; with \u2018Tatiana Gives Back\u2019 we're able to enrich the lives of the people who need it most.\u201d \u2013 Chef Kwame Onwuachi Tatiana by Kwame Onwuachi, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and Restaurant Associates support the Public Housing Community Fund\u2019s beautification and culinary arts initiatives at the New York City Housing Authority\u2019s Amsterdam Addition, Amsterdam Houses, and Harborview Terrace. This is one element of an ongoing commitment to supporting neighbors and nearby communities.

Located on historic Thompson Street, the original location features charismatic service, captains sporting tuxedos by Zac Posen, artworks by the likes of Julian Schnabel, and a menu filled with signatures inspired by the culinary history of Little Italy. CHEF MARIO CARBONE Growing up in Queens, New York, Chef Mario Carbone was steeped in two approaches to Italian cuisine: the northern elegance preserved by his maternal grandparents and the Sicilian abbondanza that defined his father\u2019s side of the family. His future path was always clear. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, Carbone spent a year in Italy that deeply connected his connection to his roots\u2014immersing himself in the flavors, techniques, and traditions that would inspire his cooking and his identity. Carbone\u2019s cooking remains rooted in the Italian classics of his childhood, emphasizing top-quality ingredients and honoring the traditions of a bygone era. THE MENU DINNER LUNCH WINE DRINKS DESSERT Select a Menu THE STORY In 2013, Chefs Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi and fellow Major Food Group co-founder Jeff Zalaznick set out to create an Italian-American restaurant for the modern era: glamorous, fun, and dedicated to the highest standards of cuisine and hospitality. Down on historic Thompson Street, after moving into the former home of the classic red sauce restaurant Rocco, they found their opportunity. Today, the words Carbone glow in neon over the original Rocco sign, honoring the neighborhood\u2019s past while welcoming guests to an electric atmosphere where many of the captains from day one oversee the \u201canything-can-happen\u201d experience. THE DESIGN The design of the original Carbone blends old-world glamour with contemporary sophistication, reflecting the restaurant's Italian-American roots. Drawing inspiration from mid-century New York and classic Italian style, the timeless space evokes the elegance of a vintage 1950s or 1960s restaurant. The rich palette of burgundy leather banquettes, gold accents, polished wood, and marble fosters an intimate, welcoming atmosphere, enhanced by soft art deco lighting. Vintage and contemporary artworks, including retro Italian movie posters and framed photos, infuse the space with character, adding nostalgic warmth and a sense of lived-in luxury. \u201cIt is a fancy red-sauce joint as directed by Quentin Tarantino, bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there.

    "text": "Carbone New York Skip to content Carbone NYC NEW YORK CITY THE ORIGINAL Carbone is one of the most celebrated Italian restaurants in America and a quintessential New York City dining experience. Located on historic Thompson Street, the original location features charismatic service, captains sporting tuxedos by Zac Posen, artworks by the likes of Julian Schnabel, and a menu filled with signatures inspired by the culinary history of Little Italy. CHEF MARIO CARBONE Growing up in Queens, New York, Chef Mario Carbone was steeped in two approaches to Italian cuisine: the northern elegance preserved by his maternal grandparents and the Sicilian abbondanza that defined his father\u2019s side of the family. His future path was always clear. After graduating from the Culinary Institute of America, Carbone spent a year in Italy that deeply connected his connection to his roots\u2014immersing himself in the flavors, techniques, and traditions that would inspire his cooking and his identity. Carbone\u2019s cooking remains rooted in the Italian classics of his childhood, emphasizing top-quality ingredients and honoring the traditions of a bygone era. THE MENU DINNER LUNCH WINE DRINKS DESSERT Select a Menu THE STORY In 2013, Chefs Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi and fellow Major Food Group co-founder Jeff Zalaznick set out to create an Italian-American restaurant for the modern era: glamorous, fun, and dedicated to the highest standards of cuisine and hospitality. Down on historic Thompson Street, after moving into the former home of the classic red sauce restaurant Rocco, they found their opportunity. Today, the words Carbone glow in neon over the original Rocco sign, honoring the neighborhood\u2019s past while welcoming guests to an electric atmosphere where many of the captains from day one oversee the \u201canything-can-happen\u201d experience. THE DESIGN The design of the original Carbone blends old-world glamour with contemporary sophistication, reflecting the restaurant's Italian-American roots. Drawing inspiration from mid-century New York and classic Italian style, the timeless space evokes the elegance of a vintage 1950s or 1960s restaurant. The rich palette of burgundy leather banquettes, gold accents, polished wood, and marble fosters an intimate, welcoming atmosphere, enhanced by soft art deco lighting. Vintage and contemporary artworks, including retro Italian movie posters and framed photos, infuse the space with character, adding nostalgic warmth and a sense of lived-in luxury. \u201cIt is a fancy red-sauce joint as directed by Quentin Tarantino, bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there. The restaurant has a technical prowess that can make you giddy and an instinct for sheer entertainment...\u201d THE NEW YORK TIMES Be among the first to know Sign up to hear about exciting new updates from Carbone and Major Food Group.

Twenty years later, Salumeria Roscioli , the deli, opened and revolutionized the restaurant world when they added a kitchen. Endless research goes into sourcing only the finest ingredients.

    "text": "17 Magical Christmas Restaurants in NYC That Feel Like Winter Wonderlands Metropolitan Shuttle: Setting the Standard for Charter Bus Rentals in 2025 Read More NYC\u2019s Christmas restaurants turn regular dining into an unforgettable holiday experience. Getting a table at these festive spots feels like hitting the jackpot \u2013 especially at Rolf\u2019s German Restaurant. This iconic holiday staple is maybe the most famous Christmas spot in the city. During Christmas, the lines wrap around the block, and you need to book weeks or even months ahead. The city showcases some truly spectacular Christmas-decorated restaurants. Papillon Bistro & Bar dazzles visitors with its striking holiday decorations. You\u2019ll find it just steps away from the famous Rockefeller Christmas Tree. Oscar Wilde stands out with New York City\u2019s longest bar, and Frosty\u2019s brings back its adults-only Christmas bar experience every holiday season. Pete\u2019s Tavern, a historic Gramercy establishment that\u2019s served guests for over a century, decks itself out in full Christmas splendor. Want to find the best places to eat, drink, and celebrate this holiday season? This piece highlights 17 festive restaurants that combine amazing food with magical Christmas atmosphere. You\u2019ll discover everything from cozy neighborhood spots to spectacular winter wonderlands \u2013 perfect for your holiday celebrations. Rolf\u2019s German Restaurant Rolf\u2019s German Restaurant sits at the corner of 22nd Street and 3rd Avenue, standing proud as NYC\u2019s most festive dining spot. This East Side gem has drawn both locals and tourists with its spectacular holiday decorations for more than 50 years. Rolf\u2019s decor and ambiance Walking into Rolf\u2019s during the holidays feels like stepping into a Christmas fairytale. Thousands of ornaments, twinkling lights, and vintage decorations hide the ceiling just inches above your head. Victorian-style dolls, antique baubles, and glittering icicles create an impressive holiday canopy throughout the space. The restaurant keeps its decorations up from late September through May, making it a Christmas destination year-round. The magic peaks in December as the decorations blend with the city\u2019s natural holiday spirit. Rolf\u2019s stands out from other Christmas-themed NYC restaurants because of its incredible ornament density. They don\u2019t just hang a few garlands \u2013 they create a magical holiday forest. Every inch gets attention, from German figurines to Victorian Christmas cards nestled between evergreen branches. The lighting sets the perfect mood. Soft, golden bulbs cast a warm glow everywhere, creating perfect spots for holiday photos that\u2019ll light up your Instagram. The bar area glows extra warm, making your wait for a table much cozier. Rolf\u2019s food and drinks The food matches the impressive decor with authentic German cuisine. The menu features hearty classics like schnitzel, sauerbraten, and various wursts. You\u2019ll get generous portions that hit the spot after a long day of holiday shopping. Customers love the potato pancakes with applesauce and the jagerschnitzel topped with mushroom sauce. The experience gets better with German beers or seasonal cocktails. Holiday season brings special winter warmers including: Hot mulled wine (Gl\u00fchwein) Spiced eggnog with optional spirits Winter-themed cocktails like the Krampus Punch German holiday beers The bartenders pour generous drinks that go great with the rich food and festive atmosphere. A drink at the bar gives you a taste of the magic, even without a dinner reservation. Rolf\u2019s pricing and reservations Here\u2019s the catch \u2013 getting into this Christmas wonderland takes work. They take reservations by phone only, and December tables need booking months ahead. Many regulars book next year\u2019s holiday table right after finishing their meal. The bar works on first-come, first-served basis. Peak season waits can stretch past two hours. Your best shot at a shorter wait is arriving right at opening (4 pm weekdays, 1 pm weekends). Prices match the unique experience \u2013 entrees run $28-38, with some specialty items costing more. Cocktails cost $15-18, a bit above typical NYC prices but fair given the magical setting. December brings a $50 per-person minimum at dinner \u2013 something to know before you visit. Most people think the splurge makes sense given the photos and memories you\u2019ll take home from this unique spot. The crowds and wait times might seem daunting, but most visitors say it\u2019s worth it. The mix of traditional German food and impressive Christmas decor creates something you won\u2019t find anywhere else in the city. Unlike temporary holiday pop-ups, Rolf\u2019s has managed to keep its Christmas traditions alive for decades, creating a genuine rather than commercial feel. Lillie\u2019s Victorian Establishment Lillie\u2019s Victorian Establishment brings the magic of a bygone era to Times Square and Union Square. Step through its ornate wooden doors and you\u2019ll find yourself surrounded by stunning holiday cheer that naturally blends with 19th-century charm. Lillie\u2019s decor and ambiance Authentic Victorian-era artifacts set Lillie\u2019s apart from other NYC Christmas restaurants. The restaurant houses genuine antiques from a Belfast mansion and England\u2019s Great Exhibition of the 1800s. This collection goes beyond holiday decorations \u2013 it\u2019s museum quality with a festive touch. Christmas season turns Lillie\u2019s into a magical Victorian holiday paradise. Garlands adorn the mahogany bar while tiny lights make the stained glass windows glow. The 19th-century woodwork creates a cozy backdrop that enhances seasonal decorations. Historical accuracy makes Lillie\u2019s truly special. Crystal chandeliers cast soft light on red velvet seats. Century-old portraits and mirrors line the walls, silent witnesses to countless celebrations. You might even spot staff in period-inspired clothes, which adds to the charm. The Times Square spot gives you a peaceful break from holiday crowds. The Union Square location feels more intimate and has its own collection of Victorian treasures. Lillie\u2019s food and drinks British pub influences mix with American comfort food on Lillie\u2019s menu. Holiday season brings special festive dishes alongside regular items: Traditional turkey dinner with all the trimmings Beef Wellington with seasonal vegetables Holiday spice-infused cocktails and mulled wine The bar serves craft beers and creative cocktails. Holiday drinks feature cinnamon-spiced hot toddies and cranberry champagne cocktails. They also make their own hot chocolate topped with candy canes. The kitchen does pub classics right. Their fish and chips come with an extra-crispy beer batter. The shepherd\u2019s pie has lamb so tender it falls apart. The sticky toffee pudding ends your holiday meal perfectly. Sunday brunch draws crowds with classic eggs Benedict and creative new dishes. Food arrives on vintage-style plates that match the Victorian setting. Lillie\u2019s pricing and reservations Lillie\u2019s prices beat many other NYC Christmas restaurants. Main dishes cost $18-29, appetizers run $10-16. Cocktails average $14-16, and beer starts at $8. You can book both locations through their website or major booking platforms. Holiday season fills up fast, so book 2-3 weeks ahead. The Times Square spot books up quicker because it\u2019s near theaters and holiday spots. Bar areas welcome walk-ins. Your best chance at getting a spot without booking is right when they open. Tuesday and Wednesday nights usually have more space than weekends. Holiday packages sometimes include set menus and guaranteed seating. Groups celebrating at peak times find these packages worth the money. Both spots stay open Monday through Friday 11am to 2am, and weekends 10am to 2am. These hours work great for after-theater meals or late-night holiday gatherings. Lillie\u2019s stands out with its real Victorian atmosphere, good food, and fair prices. It gives you a different but equally festive option compared to other Christmas spots in the city. Papillon Bistro & Bar Papillon Bistro & Bar sits just steps from Central Park and Fifth Avenue shops.

Loreley Beer Garden Loreley Beer Garden has been a cherished spot in the vibrant Lower East Side since 2003. Each winter, this first-of-its-kind Biergarten in New York City transforms into a cozy Christmas haven. The neighborhood staple provides a relaxed yet magical holiday experience. Loreley decor and ambiance The beer garden becomes a heated winter wonderland that engages both locals and visitors from mid-November through early January. Loreley brings a more relaxed approach to holiday celebrations, unlike other Christmas restaurants NYC with their elaborate Victorian themes. A heated outdoor patio adorned with twinkling Christmas lights welcomes guests in the back. The indoor space glows with festive holiday d\u00e9cor. Snow globe displays, gingerbread houses, reindeer, a life-sized Santa Claus, and Christmas trees fill the room. The ceiling sparkles with thousands of ornaments, garlands, bows, crystal icicles, and snowflakes. Owner Doug Jacobson started a mission to recreate Christmas magic for adults. \u201cThe holiday season is supposed to be such a magical time for children,\u201d Jacobson explains. \u201cI feel like, as adults, we kind of forget about it\u2026 We want to enjoy it ourselves, too\u201d. The casual atmosphere draws people seeking festive cheer without the formality of other Christmas themed restaurants NYC. Heat lamps keep guests comfortable outdoors even during cold weather. Restaurant manager Kaliope Kavalos notes, \u201cWe have people sitting outside when it\u2019s 20 degrees\u201d.

The hot chocolate and eggnog receive stellar reviews. One guest remarked, \u201cI haven\u2019t found a better spot in New York City\u201d. German-inspired beer garden classics dominate the food menu. Popular dishes include giant pretzels with warm beer cheese dip, grilled sausage platters, schnitzel, and cheese spaetzle. The freshly baked cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing are a brunch favorite, made from scratch and worth the wait.

FAQs Other FAQs What happens if there\u2019s severe weather in Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Safety is our number one priority. Atlanta can experience severe weather including thunderstorms, occasional ice storms in winter, and occasional tornado warnings. We monitor weather conditions and maintain communication with you to jointly make informed decisions. If conditions become untenable, we\u2019ll work with you to reschedule or adjust your itinerary. Do you offer charter bus services for school and university groups in Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Yes! We serve schools and universities throughout the Atlanta area. Some of our recent trips include groups from Emory University, Georgia Tech, Georgia State University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, Clark Atlanta University, and others. We provide transportation for athletic teams, academic field trips, campus tours, and special events. How far in advance should I book my Atlanta charter? \u201c/> \u201c/> Atlanta is a major destination for conventions, events and festivals (like DragonCon, 2026 FIFA World Cup, SEC Championship games, Atlanta Braves playoff games and other major sporting events). To ensure you get the vehicle type you want at a reasonable rate, we recommend booking 3 to 6 months in advance if possible. Is it customary to tip the driver? \u201c/> \u201c/> Tipping is never required, but it is a great way to show appreciation for a professional, safe driver. The industry standard is typically 10% to 20% of the total rental cost. This can be built into, and included with, a service fee on your contract, preferable for tax deductibility. Can we bring food and drinks on the bus? \u201c/> \u201c/> Most of our network charter buses in Atlanta allow snacks and bottled water. For larger meals or alcoholic beverages, we ask that you confirm this with us beforehand. Please note that a cleaning deposit will often be required to ensure the vehicle remains in top condition for future passengers. Are your buses equipped for long-distance travel from Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Absolutely. Most of our network full-sized motorcoaches come equipped with premium amenities for long hauls, including onboard restrooms, reclining seats, climate control, power outlets, and Wi-Fi. Whether you\u2019re heading to Savannah, Charleston , Nashville , or Orlando , your group will travel in comfort. For overnight trips, you will be responsible for the cost of the driver\u2019s hotel accommodations (many hotels offer complimentary driver rooms when booking a group). How do you handle game day traffic for Braves, Falcons, or Hawks games? \u201c/> \u201c/> Our team has years of experience with game day logistics for all Atlanta sports venues. We plan routes and departure times with a clear understanding of common traffic patterns. We utilize designated bus routes when available, and we coordinate with stadium operations for the most efficient drop-off and pickup. We highly recommend allowing extra travel time before kickoff or the first pitch, especially for big games. How do you handle Atlanta\u2019s notorious traffic? \u201c/> \u201c/> We recommend avoiding travel during peak rush hours (typically 7:00 AM \u2013 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM \u2013 7:00 PM) if possible. Our professional driver network is experienced with Atlanta\u2019s challenging traffic, including I-285, I-75, I-85, and is familiar with the downtown connector (I-75/85) and local shortcuts. We typically build buffer time into your itinerary to ensure your group arrives at your scheduled event on time despite delays. Alternate routes are commonly used to avoid congestion on major highways. What are the best destinations for group trips in Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Atlanta is a hub for history, culture, and sports. Groups often visit: The Centennial Park District: Home to the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, and the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. Midtown: Ideal for the Atlanta Botanical Garden, High Museum of Art, and Fox Theatre. Buckhead: Popular for the Atlanta History Center and upscale shopping. The Sweet Auburn District: Specifically for the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historical Park. We serve all of Atlanta proper and the surrounding metro area, including Alpharetta , Roswell , Sandy Springs, Marietta , Dunwoody , Decatur , Brookhaven , Johns Creek , Kennesaw , Smyrna , and many other suburbs. Whether your event is in downtown Atlanta, Buckhead, Midtown, or the outer suburbs, we can accommodate your transportation needs. We also regularly provide transportation to all major Atlanta attractions, including Mercedes-Benz Stadium, State Farm Arena, Truist Park and The Battery, the Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca-Cola, Piedmont Park, the Atlanta BeltLine, Stone Mountain Park, Fox Theatre, High Museum of Art, and more. Just let us know your itinerary, and we\u2019ll handle the logistics. Can you provide airport transfers from Hartsfield-Jackson (ATL)? \u201c/> \u201c/> Yes. For pickups at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, your driver will typically meet your group at a designated ground transportation area, often outside baggage claim on the Domestic Terminal\u2019s west curb, or specific zones at the International Terminal. Our team will monitor flight schedules in real-time to adjust for delays or early arrivals, ensuring tight coordination for your group. Because ATL is one of the world\u2019s busiest airports, we coordinate closely with your group to ensure the bus is staged and ready the moment your luggage is collected. Where can my charter bus park in downtown Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Atlanta has specific zones for oversized vehicles like buses. Popular locations like Georgia World Congress Center (GWCC) Marshalling Yard offer patrolled overnight parking for a fee. Major attractions, like the Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola , have designated bus loading lanes along Baker Street just in front of the attractions. For sporting events at Truist Park or Mercedes-Benz Stadium , bus permits should be reserved in advance to secure a spot in designated oversized lots (Lot 29 for Truist Park, and GWCC Bus Lane C on Northside Drive for Mercedes-Benz Stadium). Our team will coordinate with venue management in advance to ensure proper permits and designated parking areas. For downtown events where bus parking is restricted, we can arrange drop-off and pickup times for your convenience. How much does it cost to rent a charter bus in Atlanta? \u201c/> \u201c/> Charter bus pricing in Atlanta depends on a number of factors: the type of vehicle (full-sized charter bus vs minibus vs school bus vs passenger van), the time of year, and the duration of your trip. On average, you can expect to pay hourly for local trips (usually with a 5 hour minimum) or a day rate for out-of-town travel. To get the most accurate price, we recommend requesting a free quote with your specific itinerary or contact us at (678) 252-5503 . We provide transparent pricing with no hidden fees. General Questions How can a charter bus rental accommodate different group sizes? \u201c/> \u201c/> Our charter bus services offer a range of vehicles , from smaller minibuses suitable for 18 passengers to larger buses that can comfortably seat up to 56 passengers, ensuring that groups of any size can be accommodated. Are there accessible options for individuals with mobility concerns? \u201c/> \u201c/> Yes, Metropolitan Shuttle offers ADA-accessible buses , catering to travelers with mobility needs to ensure everyone can travel comfortably and safely. What level of professionalism can be expected from your charter bus services? \u201c/> \u201c/> Metropolitan Shuttle works with the most experienced local operators and professionals, ensuring that you have a skilled driver to manage your group\u2019s travel needs. Which cities or regions are you able to serve? \u201c/> \u201c/> All of the major cities and many smaller cities in the United States are served by our nationwide charter bus services . How can I determine what kind of bus I require? \u201c/> \u201c/> Our experts assist you in choosing the best bus rental for your needs based on your schedule, group size, and preferred amenities. What kinds of charter buses are available? \u201c/> \u201c/> Metropolitan Shuttle offers motor coaches, minibuses, party buses, executive coaches, limo buses, school buses, shuttle buses, and luxury buses are just a few of the many vehicles we provide. How many video monitors do the buses have? \u201c/> \u201c/> Deluxe charter buses will typically have four to six video monitors. Minibuses will have 1-3. Can I charter a minibus for an overnight trip? \u201c/> \u201c/> Minibuses are not designed for long-distance travel. They are much lower to the ground and therefore far less comfortable for passengers travelling on the highway. Few, if any, operators will allow their minibuses to travel much more than 100 miles out of a given city. Who arranges and pays for the driver\u2019s hotel room? \u201c/> \u201c/> Typically, the client will be responsible for booking the driver\u2019s room on overnight trips. Often, if you ask, hotels will add a complimentary room for the driver when you book rooms for a large group. If I don\u2019t need the bus for the whole day, will I still need to pay for it for the entire day? \u201c/> \u201c/> Most charter services have four- or five-hour minimums on bus rentals. Therefore, if your event is from 9am to 5pm and you\u2019re renting a bus for transportation both to and from, it could cost the same amount to keep the vehicle for the day as it would to have it leave and come back for the return trip. However, there are occasions when we can offer special one-way transfer rates to accommodate those types of circumstances. 866-556-3545 Get a Quote Ready to book your Atlanta charter bus trip?

START YOUR REVIEW OF Sunny and Annie\u2019s Your overall rating Your name Address Your review Send Review Terry T. Excellent Korean deli. Wide array of sandwiches. Friendly staff only complaint is that is so good. It's always really crowded. Such a tiny space and they packed it so much that there's no room for bodies isles marriage narrow there's always a lot of people in there so rightfully because it's good and popular and great what classic New York bacon, egg, and cheese they h have one of everything in that tiny little, space. It's a little pricey but that's the sacrifice for convenience. It's not even that much more than a. Grocery store just a couple of cents per product. Chris S. Really cool hole in the wall spot. Sandwich had amazing flavors. Had the Pho 1 on A Man and His Sandwich tour. Was great. Would definitely like to come back Anthony P. This unique bodega offers a large menu of asian-inspired deli sandwiches that include bulgogi, for example. The sandwiches are huge too. The owner is Korean and you can feel that cultural influence in the menu. Lots of interesting flavor combination to choose from, with each sandwich hefty with a ton of ingredients. I think this place is super fun, and I got the Jackie Chan which admittedly I didn't enjoy terribly, but I also wasn't super hungry, but there were other sandwiches that seemed appealing and I want to come back to try those. As a bodega, this place is awesome as it has a wide variety of snacks, drinks, coffee, including some international items too. This is clearly a staple for the neighborhood as well, as many locals came in to grab their sleepy Sunday bodega sandwich. Wishing this place all the luck! Danielle L. Are you craving a bowl of pho but don't have enough time then look no further, get a Pho 1 sandwich from Sunny and Annie's. The sandwich was stuffed with roast beef, bean sprouts, cilantro, avocado and tomato, and doused with hoisin sauce and sirarcha. It doesn't taste exactly like pho but it is certainly creative and unique. Carmen G. When duties call, Sunny and Annie's delivers. I was craving a sausage, egg white and cheese on a roll and found this place. It's a bit out of the way but my boyfriend traveled all the way there just to get it for my dinner. Yes! That was all I wanted. Could I have gotten it from the bodega around the corner from me? Yes, but... It wouldn't have that NY feel to it like Sunny and Annie's. The sandwich was cheesy and they remembered egg whites instead of regular eggs. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good sandwich. It hit the spot for me. Tara D. Every city has food available after midnight, but it varies a lot on quality, and it's often all very unhealthy. One of the lovely things about NYC is that a % of delicatessens are open very late or 24/7, giving you options for great sandwiches and subs (admittedly, some healthier than others!) They are usually within or connected to a neighborhood market, feeding your fix for middle of the night instant ramen, your ooops, I'm out of TP, or f***, I need Nyquil. This delicatessen/store was particularly clean, inside and out. Well-stocked. Definitely recommend! Service was quick, the sandwich was large and tasty Gab G. Clearly a neighborhood staple, this place is a bodega with a completely insane sandwich menu, aka heaven. I went with The Biden and was not disappointed. Service was friendly. Take your sandwich to the nearby Tompkins Square Park if you need a place to eat it! Wayne C. There's a pretty strong and widely held belief that pizza is the go-to food when visiting the neighborhood haunts of New York City. Yes, the pizza is pretty good - however . . . New York's greatest contribution to local neighborhood centric eats is the deli sandwich. There are delis - all manner, kind, and taste - in every neighborhood in every borough. The best of the absolute best is Sunny and Annie's. Be still my heart - these sandwiches rock your world. Yes, it can be a little intimidating to walk into this small corner store and find your way to the deli - but don't be deterred, you got this. Make your sandwich selection, grab some chips, get a cold beverage and walk to the cash register. You pay and then wait for your order pick-up by the front door - doing your best to not block the flow of customers comings and goings. It is so worth any amount of stress this new experience may create. These are the best sandwiches you will ever have. Hands down. The best! A word of caution- some of the sandwich combinations seem really out there. Go with it! Avoid the temptation to make a substitution or omit an item or two. Just go for it. And, yes - pesto, provolone, cantaloupe, avocado and chile hot sauce are a magical combination. Johnny N. To be quite honest, I've really never been a sandwich guy. I don't know what it is, I would just almost always rather eat other things. I never really just sit and crave a sandwich, you know? THAT HAS ALL CHANGED. I was lowkey pressed to come here by a friend who said \"YOU LIVE IN ALPHABET CITY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUNNY AND ANNIES?!\" I'm paraphrasing again, but that was the vibe. I'll be honest, I walked in one time and was so intimidated by the size of that menu that I walked right out. I went back about a week later as Sunny and Annie's was again hyped up to me. I tried the pho 1, as it looked like one of there more popular sandwiches. That sandwich literally changed my life. I was so skeptical as I love pho, but couldn't imagine those ingredients being good not in a broth. One of my greatest strengths as a man and as a human being is admitting when I'm wrong, and I was dead wrong about this. It was honestly better than pho. I'm still having trouble wrapping my brain around it. Anyways, that's it. I prob won't try any other sandwich from here for a couple months but I'm sure they are delicious. Sunny and Annie\u2019s Experience the best of Asian-inspired deli sandwiches at Sunny and Annie's in New York City. With a wide array of flavorful options, this neighborhood staple offers classics like bacon, egg, and cheese alongside innovative creations like the Pho 1 sandwich.

This is clearly a staple for the neighborhood as well, as many locals came in to grab their sleepy Sunday bodega sandwich. Wishing this place all the luck! Danielle L. Are you craving a bowl of pho but don't have enough time then look no further, get a Pho 1 sandwich from Sunny and Annie's. The sandwich was stuffed with roast beef, bean sprouts, cilantro, avocado and tomato, and doused with hoisin sauce and sirarcha. It doesn't taste exactly like pho but it is certainly creative and unique. Carmen G. When duties call, Sunny and Annie's delivers. I was craving a sausage, egg white and cheese on a roll and found this place. It's a bit out of the way but my boyfriend traveled all the way there just to get it for my dinner. Yes! That was all I wanted. Could I have gotten it from the bodega around the corner from me? Yes, but... It wouldn't have that NY feel to it like Sunny and Annie's. The sandwich was cheesy and they remembered egg whites instead of regular eggs. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good sandwich. It hit the spot for me. Tara D. Every city has food available after midnight, but it varies a lot on quality, and it's often all very unhealthy. One of the lovely things about NYC is that a % of delicatessens are open very late or 24/7, giving you options for great sandwiches and subs (admittedly, some healthier than others!) They are usually within or connected to a neighborhood market, feeding your fix for middle of the night instant ramen, your ooops, I'm out of TP, or f***, I need Nyquil. This delicatessen/store was particularly clean, inside and out. Well-stocked. Definitely recommend! Service was quick, the sandwich was large and tasty Gab G. Clearly a neighborhood staple, this place is a bodega with a completely insane sandwich menu, aka heaven. I went with The Biden and was not disappointed. Service was friendly. Take your sandwich to the nearby Tompkins Square Park if you need a place to eat it! Wayne C. There's a pretty strong and widely held belief that pizza is the go-to food when visiting the neighborhood haunts of New York City. Yes, the pizza is pretty good - however . . . New York's greatest contribution to local neighborhood centric eats is the deli sandwich. There are delis - all manner, kind, and taste - in every neighborhood in every borough. The best of the absolute best is Sunny and Annie's. Be still my heart - these sandwiches rock your world. Yes, it can be a little intimidating to walk into this small corner store and find your way to the deli - but don't be deterred, you got this. Make your sandwich selection, grab some chips, get a cold beverage and walk to the cash register. You pay and then wait for your order pick-up by the front door - doing your best to not block the flow of customers comings and goings. It is so worth any amount of stress this new experience may create. These are the best sandwiches you will ever have. Hands down. The best! A word of caution- some of the sandwich combinations seem really out there. Go with it! Avoid the temptation to make a substitution or omit an item or two. Just go for it. And, yes - pesto, provolone, cantaloupe, avocado and chile hot sauce are a magical combination. Johnny N. To be quite honest, I've really never been a sandwich guy. I don't know what it is, I would just almost always rather eat other things. I never really just sit and crave a sandwich, you know? THAT HAS ALL CHANGED. I was lowkey pressed to come here by a friend who said \"YOU LIVE IN ALPHABET CITY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUNNY AND ANNIES?!\" I'm paraphrasing again, but that was the vibe. I'll be honest, I walked in one time and was so intimidated by the size of that menu that I walked right out. I went back about a week later as Sunny and Annie's was again hyped up to me. I tried the pho 1, as it looked like one of there more popular sandwiches. That sandwich literally changed my life. I was so skeptical as I love pho, but couldn't imagine those ingredients being good not in a broth. One of my greatest strengths as a man and as a human being is admitting when I'm wrong, and I was dead wrong about this. It was honestly better than pho. I'm still having trouble wrapping my brain around it. Anyways, that's it. I prob won't try any other sandwich from here for a couple months but I'm sure they are delicious. Sunny and Annie\u2019s Experience the best of Asian-inspired deli sandwiches at Sunny and Annie's in New York City.

Friendly staff only complaint is that is so good. It's always really crowded.

It's a little pricey but that's the sacrifice for convenience. It's not even that much more than a. Grocery store just a couple of cents per product. Chris S. Really cool hole in the wall spot. Sandwich had amazing flavors. Had the Pho 1 on A Man and His Sandwich tour. Was great. Would definitely like to come back Anthony P.

Soon enough, people caught on to her exceptional cheesecakes, which became so in-demand that she expanded her business into a successful bakery in downtown Manhattan in 1975. Being so close to Little Italy helped her retail business blossom, and her warm personality made her an instant hit in the neighborhood. She referred to the bakery\u2019s location at 17 Cleveland Place as \u201cour lucky corner\u201d. Once a sleepy block in SoHo, it is now a bustling location in one of the most popular neighborhoods in New York City. In 2000, Eileen\u2019s opened a kiosk between the two towers of the World Trade Center to sell her acclaimed cheesecakes to tourists and office workers every afternoon. On September 11th the kiosk was destroyed, but Eileen\u2019s carried on in the bakery baking for the rescue workers. Eileen was an entrepreneurial visionary who created a thriving business out of her natural talent and kind heart. Her two daughters, Holly Maloney and Bonnie Ponte, grew up during the early years of the business, spending their summers at the store. It became a part of who they are, and eventually they began to run the business with their mother. Today, the two daughters carry on the tradition of this women-run family business, and continue the legacy. \u201cIt\u2019s all about family and tradition\u201d, Holly says. From locals to visitors from around the world, Eileen\u2019s Special Cheesecake is a cult favorite, with a constant line out the door of eager cheesecake lovers ready to savor their favorite flavor. Each cheesecake is handmade at the original downtown bakery, with some employees who have been there for over 40 years. Eileen often said what set her cakes apart was the quality of ingredients, which can easily be tasted once you sink your teeth into one! Light and creamy texture with the perfect balance of sweet and tangy, hand-pressed graham cracker crusts, flavorful fruit compotes, and top-notch ingredients make Eileen\u2019s cheesecakes special and a premium product. Eileen\u2019s Cheesecakes are the quintessential NYC dessert. Every Eileen\u2019s Cheesecake is made with love and captures the heart and soul of this family\u2019s passion for cheesecake in every bite. \u201cTHERE\u2019S NOTHING FACTORY ABOUT OUR CHEESECAKES\u201d \u2014 Eileen Handmade Cheesecakes Made fresh daily!

Shibui is never complicated or contrived. Purity of being, of living, of sensing is inherent in all elements of the Masa experience. A fundamental respect of the distinctiveness, which is naturally occurring, is observed with each act of slicing, shaving and sprinkling. The food is prepared quickly, and plated for guests as soon as ready to preserve the idea that each dish is still in a living, being state. The sushi counter, made of a single solid piece of Hinoki, is sanded daily to a soft, porous state providing visual and tactile satisfaction. Seasonal branches are arranged daily to highlight the beautiful imperfections mother nature produces, offering a unique perspective from all angles. The simple decor is intentionally minimal to act as a blank canvas on which the food is allotted space to shine. The courses build on seasonal ingredients offered only in their freshest most delicious state. Every dish is composed to ensure that the innate character of each ingredient persists.\u00c2 Chef Masa Takayama brings together traditional Japanese technique and modern artistry in ways that feel both singular and untouched. Renowned for his precision and creativity, he crafts an immersive, highly elevated omakase experience that reveals the purity and character of each ingredient.

Born in the 50\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, Masayoshi Takayama's immersion in the culinary world began at a young age. Growing up in a family that owned a fish shop and catering business, he was actively involved in the operations, from delivering fresh sashimi to neighbors on his bicycle to assisting in the preparation of elaborate multi-course meals for weddings during high school. Initially aspiring to become a surgeon, Takayama shifted his focus to the culinary arts. After high school, he apprenticed for eight years at the renowned Ginza Sushiko in Tokyo, a period that involved rigorous training in traditional Japanese culinary techniques. In 1978, Takayama visited Los Angeles, which led to his decision to move to the United States in 1980. He opened his first restaurant, Saba-ya, followed by Ginza Sushiko in Beverly Hills. The latter quickly gained a reputation as one of Los Angeles's most expensive dining establishments, offering an omakase experience that attracted discerning patrons.\u00c2 In 2004, Takayama opened his eponymous restaurant, Masa, in the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in New York City. The restaurant's intimate 26-seat setting and exclusive omakase menu garnered immediate acclaim. Masa was the first Japanese restaurant in the U.S. to receive three Michelin stars, a testament to Takayama's commitment to excellence. Building on his success, Takayama expanded his culinary footprint with the opening of Bar Masa, adjacent to Masa on the fourth floor. In 2014, he partnered with art dealer Larry Gagosian to open Kappo Masa located in Manhattan's Upper East Side. This venture aimed to offer a more casual dining experience while maintaining the high standards associated with \u00e2\u0080\u00a8his brand. The menu at Kappo Masa complements the Chef\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tasting journey while maintaining the same level of precision and artistry. 02 Cuisine Chef Masa's culinary philosophy centers on the principles of \"shibui\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 SUBTLE BEAUTY, QUIET ELEGANCE, SIMPLICITY AND COMPLEXITY. Masa Toro Cartare Caviar Masa Pasta Ume Shiso Pickled Lotus Sushi Display \u00e2\u0080\u009cForm is not decoration - it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the visible trace of invisible intention.

    "text": "Our Story-Xi'an Famous Foods: specialty Chinese restaurants serving Xi'an dishes based on family recipes Xi'an, China My family comes from Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099an, the ancient capital of China. Its claim to fame is the terracotta soldiers and the start of the Silk Road \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a long trade route that stretched all the way beyond the Roman Empire. All that trade (the spices, the cultures) melded into a food culture unique to the region. Today it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bustling city \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fancy car dealerships and bougie hotels and restaurants and hidden speakeasies dot the city center. But I remember it as a dusty, quiet city, filled with trees and birds and crickets and mapped by the food: the Muslim Quarters for smoky lamb skewers; sticky and sweet mirror cakes sold in stalls by my school; spicy and starchy hu la tang for breakfast and tomato and egg noodles at the spot down the street. This is the place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and these are the flavors \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that started it all.\u00c2 The Father My dad, David, was always a scrappy guy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost built into his generation, when being hungry was a fact of life and you had to hustle to get your hands on food. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that scrappy, never-let-food-waste mentality that helped him get through the muck when we first moved to the United States. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how he ended up in the restaurant business, doing whatever he could to make ends meet. His first jobs were as a dishwasher for a Chinese buffet restaurant His first jobs were as a dishwasher for a Chinese buffet restaurant, hopping on a bus for two hours to get an extra 60 bucks. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d drag himself all up and down the east coast for weeks at a time, taking any job that would pay, crashing at boarding houses with other gig workers in the same boat.\u00c2 But even in Chinese immigrant enclaves, the food of our hometown was nowhere to be found. So, he made it himself. When he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shilling orange chicken or prepping beef and broccoli for buffets, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be testing out new family favorites. Then, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d come home and make some bombass fried chicken for me. When he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shilling orange chicken or prepping beef and broccoli for buffets, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be testing out new family favorites When he was ready to strike out on his own, he started small: first with a bubble tea shop, where the food soon outsold the drinks. Then, he put money down on a random enclave by a bus stop, literally a nook on the street without a door. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cook and prep at home, wheeling over the goods to serve out of his hole-in-the-wall to workers picking up a bite before their shifts. Finally, in 2005, he earned enough to nab a stall in the legendary Golden Shopping Mall basement food court. Word spread. Business was good and steady. Then Bourdain showed up and things got a little crazy. The SON I was born in Xi\u00e2\u0080\u0099an, and like my father, developed a taste for spicy cumin lamb and noodles. But when I was 8, we moved to the United States, swapping cumin lamb skewers for the chance to have a better life. That vision for my life included studying business at an American college, getting a white collar job, and never having to worry about working in a kitchen.\u00c2 While my dad was on buses en route to his next cooking gig, I was head down in books... While my dad was on buses en route to his next cooking gig, I was head down in books, under pressure to get into a good college and, as a result, get a good corporate job. And for a while, all was going according to plan. I went to a college with a well-known business program , interned at tech companies, and finally got a starting position at a big corporation. I had all the ingredients to live my parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 version of the good life.\u00c2 But once XFF started, I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it out of my head. At my dad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, I had my first taste of liang pi in 10 years. The lamb noodles brought back memories of housing lamb skewers at the Muslim Quarters \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only thing I wanted to eat as a kid. So I knew my dad had hit on something big, and I knew I had to do everything I could to turn this business into a legacy. So I took my college degree, my corporate training, my white collar dreams, and went INto the kitchen So I took my college degree, my corporate training, my white collar dreams, and went back to the kitchen, starting from taking out the trash and slowly working my way up to cashier, line cook, and finally, manager. It took two years\u00c2 of 13-hour work days until my dad decided I was finally ready.\u00c2 THE\u00c2 BUSINESS After my dad and I went into business together, we went full-steam ahead. We opened up a spot in East Village (adjacent photo), tried out sit-down options, tested some new offerings, pulled some others, fought about menu items and trainings and the best way to cook dumplings. Then, and slowly, we figured out who we were as a company. That company is this: Food first. REALLY good food, first. We still make our liang pi the old way, still hand-pull our noodles to order for that perfect bouncy bite. My dad is still in the kitchen personally making our chili oil , still getting burned when the oil gets too hot. He wears his burns proudly. And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proud for a reason. His recipes, first presented in a tiny hole-in-the-wall, have brought lines down the block, television crews, restaurant critics, and many a foodie. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve necessitated baby strollers full of noodle sauce to be wheeled over to store locations in the dead of winter. Our fans have followed us since the days he pushed baby strollers full of noodle sauce to our first location in Queens. They hoard our chili oil packets and order noodle kits across the country, just so they can have a taste wherever they are.\u00c2 And his brand has grown beyond Queens after more than twenty (20)\u00c2 years in business , now with twenty-three (23)\u00c2 100% family company-owned locations (no franchisees, no investors accepted) across prime neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and as well as farther away in the Boston, Philadelphia, and Greater DC areas. Want in? Come on over. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see exactly why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re famous. - Jason Wang CEO, Xi'an Famous Foods Menu Our Story Locations Press Contact Shop Jobs Pickup/Delivery Catering privacy policy Accessibility \u00c2\u00a9 Xi'an Famous Foods 2025",

    "text": "ABOUT | Aska top of page ABOUT Originally from Stockholm, Sweden, chef Fredrik Berselius has spent most of his culinary career in New York City, bringing his love for nature to his urban surroundings through food. \u200b Berselius opened Aska \u2013 Swedish for \u2018ashes\u2019 \u2013 in its first rendition in 2012, garnering acclaim for bridging the culinary heritage of his upbringing with the immediate environs of his Brooklyn address. Within a year, Aska earned Berselius his first Michelin star, and Bon Appetit named Aska one of the ten best new restaurants in America. \u200b In the summer of 2016, Aska reopened in a new, bilevel space \u2013 with a main dining room, garden, and cellar bar \u2013 located in a restored 1860s warehouse building near the edge of the Williamsburg Bridge. Within a few months, Aska earned Berselius his second Michelin star, being one of only ten restaurants in the city to hold the honor. Shortly thereafter, Aska received a three star New York Times review by Pete Wells. \u200b With an emphasis on ingredients from the surrounding Northeastern U.S. region and influenced by Berselius\u2019 Scandinavian homeland, Aska offers a distinctive dining experience through a procession of courses prepared from an open kitchen and served to guests of only ten tables each night. \u200b Berselius recently released his first cookbook, Aska, published by Phaidon, in the spring of 2018. bottom of page",
